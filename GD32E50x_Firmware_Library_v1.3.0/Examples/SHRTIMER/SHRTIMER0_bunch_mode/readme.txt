  This example is based on the GD32E507Z-EVAL-V1.0 board. This example shows how to 
configure the bunch mode.The bunch mode controller allows to have the ST0_CH0_O 
channel (PA8) and ST0_CH1_O channel (PA9) alternatively in IDLE(4 periods) and RUN 
state (3 periods) by hardware. When in IDLE state the channel output inactive level. 
When in RUN state the channel output PWM waveformwith a period of 1us.
  The waveforms on pins of PA8 and PA9 can be observed by oscilloscope.
